                For Windows, when you install a package, you type:

                        python -m pip install [packagename]


* If speak function does not working properly.

        Check if it's imported or not.

                from win32com.client import Dispatch
                speak=Dispatch("SAPI.spVoice")
                speak.Speak(string)
